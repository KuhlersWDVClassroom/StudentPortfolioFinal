        <p>
            I worked at Subway originally as a Sandwich Artist and my job would be to: make sandwiches, ring up customers, bake bread, clean everything, wash dishes, and other things. After about a few months of doing that, I had got a promotion to <b>Keyholder</b>, and a Keyholder is a person whom holds the key to the store and is in-charge while supervision/management are out of the store. My job as a Keyholder would be supervising everybody to ensure nobody would steal anything and I also had to do counts to make sure the drawer isn't missing a whole bunch of money. I would also have to fill the change machine and count the safe daily. I've had my job for about <b>two years.</b>

        <p>
            I am an Xbox Ambassador and love to help other people. What I do with the Xbox Ambassador program is that I go out on the Xbox community forms and respond to question and discussion posts to help others or encourage a friendly community of people. I also play games with others on Xbox and help out new gamers by making them feel welcome or sharing some personal tips about Xbox. One great thing about the program is that it gives me access to things to help push positive things in the community such as our video gallery. In the video gallery, I can either upload or review views others submit and determine if they would be great to be posted on the Xbox Youtube channel.

    <h3>Link Crew ( 2018 - Present )</h3>
        <p>
            During my Junior and Senior year of high school, I participated in a club called Link Crew, and what we do is help newer students and organize events for them. During the summer, we would help make posters, organize nametags, plan out how orientation would go, and called some of the incoming freshmen to let them know about orientation. We would take the students around the building and give them a tour while also making them feel welcome by playing a few games such as the name game. It helped them make a few new friends to start high school with and really impacted how they felt about the transition from middle to high school. Another thing we do during the year is give presentations to the freshmen about different subjects such as certain school policies and PSAs. We also walked them through MVP training.

    <h3>Office Leader ( 2016 - 2017 )</h3>
        <p>
            While I was a Lunch Leader, I had also been volunteering as an Office Leader, during that job I would sit at the front desk and ask people to sign in while also pushing the button to unlock the door into the office when people rang the doorbell. I would also run out recyling and sometimes garbages, or I would have to sort papers and documents in my free time. Usually when a new kid would come to our school or we had elementary children in the building, my job would be to give that person a tour, or if someone's parent had needed to pull them out of school, I would run the pass to their classroom.
        </p>
    <h3>Lunch Leader ( 2015 - 2017 )</h3>
        <p>
            When I attended Hoover Middle School, I had volunteered to be a Lunch Leader. I had started during 7th grade and our job was mainly wiping off tables, moving them to the sides of the room, and last but not least, digging trays out of the garbage that kids would throw. We would also be in-charge of taking out the trash when it got full or sweeping and mopping the floor depending on how bad it was. We always got the cafeteria ready for the janitor to clean.
