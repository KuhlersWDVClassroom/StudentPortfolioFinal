    <h2>Values</h2>
    <p>I enjoy all of these things listed above but above two of them I love to talk to my friends and hang out with them
        I get to be able to tell my friends about everything and we also do a lot together so it turns out to be a great time.
        Being around people and being able to talk to them is one of the hobbies I value the most. I value being able to talk to 
        people to learn and experience new things. I wish to be able to take my intrest in computers and computer programming farther
        than just an intrest and into a career. I enjoy listening to music. I listen to almost anything except for country and operas.
        One of the things that I value the most is perfection and the idea that I can make things better and improve constantly.

    </p>
