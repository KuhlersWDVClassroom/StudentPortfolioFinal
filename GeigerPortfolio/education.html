    <p>I am a sophmore in highschool determined to get very good grades. I currently have all A's and B's in my classes. 
        I am also taking the Intro to Web Development at the WCC (Waterloo Career Center) to learn how to program websites and customize them.
        I have taken many electives in highschool, but by far the most interesting and career related class I've taken has to be
        Intro to Web Development. It is leading me into a path that I can get a career in the field of programming or Computer Science.
